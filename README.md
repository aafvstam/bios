This repository contains a short bio for various managed language "insiders". 
Insiders are mostly Microsoft MVPs, but can also include other people who are influential in
the managed languages space, including people from Microsoft.

Creating a bio page here is completely voluntary and on an individual basis.

## Contributing
If you want to create a bio here, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request or get in touch with me to add one for you. If you submit a pull request, you're free to include pretty much any information you want (just keep in mind that it will be public). To keep things consistent, please name the file with your first and last name.

*Alternatively, as long as your current MVP standing can be verified, you can be added to the "MVP" team which will give you contributor rights to this repository.*
